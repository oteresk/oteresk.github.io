  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>As an artist, I am determined to create content that is meaningful to others. On this website, I will be uploading my
  works as they are finished. Though I personally am striving for a career in video games, I believe that video is a powerful method of 
    conveying messages. Aside from Video Games and Video Art, I also enjoy photography and will be uploading more of my photography projects here.
