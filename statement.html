  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>As an artist, I am determined to create content that is meaningful to others. On this website, I will be uploading my
  works as they are finished. Though I personally am striving for a career in video games, I believe that video is a powerful metho of conveying messages and I would like to take this opportunity to help offer my perspectives on various topics.
