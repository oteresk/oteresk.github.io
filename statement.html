  <h2><a href="statement.html">Artist Statement</a></h2>
  <p>As an artist, I am determined to create content that is meaningful to others. Each of my works is created through non-traditional digital mediums, such as 3D modeling, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects, digital photography, and HTML. I have 7 years experience in Adobe Photoshop, 6 years experience in 3D modeling in Cinema 4D, 3 years experience in digital photography, and one year of experience in HTML. Though I personally am striving for a career in video games, I believe that there is a powerful method of conveying messages in each piece of art, no matter what medium. A common theme among several works of mine is abstraction focused on a singular subject. However, I enjoy experimenting with various subject matters, particularly in photography.
